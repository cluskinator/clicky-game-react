# Clicky-Game Homework for George Washington University Full Stack Development Bootcamp

This is a memory game designed in React.  

Rules:

You may click the card of Archer (or any card) to begin.  The cards will then shuffle and you will receive 1 point. If you click on any card other than Archer, you will receive another point. If you click on Archer again, however, you will lose the game.  

The goal of the game is to click on all cards without duplicating one.

Good luck!
